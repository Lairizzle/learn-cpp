// Write a single-file program (named main.cpp) that reads two
// separate integers from the user, adds them together, and then
// outputs the answer. The program should use three functions:

// A function named “readNumber” should be used to get
//(and return) a single integer from the user.
// A function named “writeAnswer” should be used to output the answer.
// This function should take a single parameter and have no return value.
// A main() function should be used to glue the above functions together.

// Question #2

// Modify the program you wrote in exercise #1 so that readNumber()
// and writeAnswer() live in a separate file called “io.cpp”.
// Use a forward declaration to access them from main().

// Question #
// Modify the program you wrote in #2 so that it uses a header file
//(named io.h) to access the functions instead of
// using forward declarations directly in your code (.cpp) files.
// Make sure your header file uses header guards.

#include "io.h"

int main() {
    int x{readNumber()};
    int y{readNumber()};
    writeAnswer(x + y);
    return 0;
}
